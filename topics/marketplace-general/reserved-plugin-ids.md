[//]: # (title: Reserved plugin IDs)

If a company has [custom repositories](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#repos) with internal plugins for IntelliJ-based IDEs, there may be name collisions between these plugins and third-party plugins on the JetBrains Marketplace. To overcome this, it is now possible to reserve plugin IDs in the organization settings.

An [organization administrator](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/roles.html#organization-administrator) can reserve plugin IDs on the 'People & Plugins' tab in the organization settings. One organization can have no more than five reserved IDs. If, for some reason, you need more, please get in touch with Marketplace support.

Please note that one cannot reserve IDs of the plugins already uploaded on the Marketplace. Please also note that if you decide to upload your internal plugin with a reserved ID on the Marketplace, please remove the ID entry in the organization settings first.
