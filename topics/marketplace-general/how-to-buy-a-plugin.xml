    <p>Buying a plugin license is easy! Read on this step-by-step guide to go through the process as smoothly as
        possible.

        <p>All plugins come with a 30-day trial period, so you can test them out before buying a license:</p>
        <step>
            Use the “Search” field in the <control>Plugin Manager</control> to find the plugin you want.
        </step>
        <step>
            <control>Install</control>
            the plugin and restart your IDE.
            <note>You will need to restart the IDE every time you install a paid plugin. If you skip this step,
                the plugin will be disabled.
            </note>
        </step>
        <step>
            Activate the trial-period by selecting <control>“Evaluate for free”</control> in the license
            activation window that pops up.
        </step>
    </procedure>

    <p>You can make the purchase directly from your IDE (Plugin Manager) or through the Plugin page on JetBrains
        Marketplace:
