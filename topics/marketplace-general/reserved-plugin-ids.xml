    <p>If a company has <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#repos">custom repositories
    </a> with
        internal plugins for IntelliJ-based IDEs, there may be name collisions between these plugins and third-party
        plugins on the JetBrains Marketplace. To overcome this, it is now possible to reserve plugin IDs in the
        organization settings.
    </p>

    <p>An <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/roles.html#organization-administrator">organization
        administrator
    </a> can reserve
        plugin IDs on the <control>People &amp; Plugins</control> tab in the organization settings. One organization can
        have no more than
        five reserved IDs. If, for some reason, you need more, please get in touch with Marketplace support.
    </p>

    <p>Please note that one cannot reserve IDs of the plugins already uploaded on the Marketplace. Please also note that
        if you decide to upload your internal plugin with a reserved ID on the Marketplace, please remove the ID entry
        in the organization settings first.
