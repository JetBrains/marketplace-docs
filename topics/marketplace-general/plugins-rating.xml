    <p>We use a <emphasis>Bayesian Rating</emphasis> to calculate the rating displayed for each JetBrains Marketplace plugin and within the product. The precise formula we are using is:
    </p>

    <p>
        <code style="block">bayesianRating = (sum(userRatings) + 2 * meanVote) / (count(userRatings) + 2)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>meanVote</code> is an average vote of all plugins on JetBrains Marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>It may be confusing that the plugin rating is not 5, while all votes are five stars. However, we use the Bayesian rating to avoid the situation when the plugin with a few 5-star votes is rated higher than the plugins with many diverse votes (not all of them are five stars.)
