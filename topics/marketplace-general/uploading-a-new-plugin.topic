    <chapter title="Uploading TeamCity Recipes" id="upload-teamcity-recipes" help-id="upload-teamcity-recipes">

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/working-with-meta-runner.html">TeamCity Recipes</a> are custom build steps that can be added to TeamCity build configurations. TeamCity supports two types of recipes:
        </p>

        <list>
            <li><b>Private recipes</b> — recipes that are not uploaded to JetBrains Marketplace. Typically, these are extracted from existing build configurations on a TeamCity server, and only used on the same server.</li>
            <li><b>Public recipes</b> — JetBrains Marketplace recipes authored by JetBrains or 3rd-party vendors. If a TeamCity project allows public recipes (<b>Project Settings | Recipes</b>), these recipes are shown next to built-in TeamCity steps.

                <img src="mp-recipes-in-tc-ui.png" width="706" alt="Marketplace recipes in TeamCity UI"/>
            </li>
        </list>

        <p>
            When uploading new TeamCity recipes to JetBrains Marketplace, make sure you select <b>TeamCity Recipes</b> in the <b>Plugin For</b> drop-down menu, and select a YAML recipe definition to upload.
        </p>

        <img src="mp-upload-tc-recipe.png" width="706" alt="Upload new TeamCity recipes"/>

        <p>
            Since public recipes can appear together in the TeamCity UI, they must have unique IDs. A recipe ID combines a vendor namespace and a recipe name. For example, the following recipe has the <code>jetbrains/pin-build</code> ID, where <code>jetbrains</code> is the namespace and <code>pin-build</code> is the recipe name.
        </p>

        <code-block lang="yaml">
            name: jetbrains/pin-build
            version: 1.0.0
            description: |
                Pins the specific build to prevent it from being removed during a scheduled clean-up.
                ...
        </code-block>

        <p>
            When uploading your first recipe, enter a namespace in the corresponding field to create it. All future recipes you upload should use the same namespace in their YAML files.
        </p>

        <tip>
            To remove a namespace, edit your <a href="vendor-profile.topic">vendor page</a> and switch to the <b>Plugins</b> tab. Note that you should first delete all recipes associated with a namespace to remove it.

            <img src="mp-delete-namespace.png" width="706" alt="Delete TeamCity recipe namespace"/>
        </tip>

        <p>
            Other settings (vendor details, license type, source code URL, and so on) are specified <a href="#plugin-details">identically to regular plugins</a>.
        </p>
