[//]: # (title: Create Your Marketplace Listing)

The Marketplace plugin page is the webpage used for JetBrains Marketplace listings. It provides users with useful links and information about your plugin’s functionality,  product compatibility, versions, and pricing (if applicable).  When you upload a plugin to JetBrains Marketplace, it becomes available to over 10 million users of JetBrains products. They can download, evaluate, and buy your plugin from the plugin page, as well as rate and review it.

A high-quality page is essential to attracting and engaging new customers, which will result in a higher number of downloads. So, it is important to prepare appropriate, high-quality content for the plugin page before uploading it to the Marketplace.

After uploading a plugin to Marketplace, it will be manually reviewed by the Marketplace team. You will be contacted and asked to make changes if we find anything that doesn’t fit our guidelines. To speed up the review process, make sure the information you provide is complete and correct. Note that the plugin page requirements are subject to change, as the Marketplace is constantly evolving. Be prepared to adjust to new requirements as they come out.

<note><p>We may review published plugins at our discretion. We reserve the right to unpublish a plugin if an author rejects or doesn’t respond to our requests for adjustments.</p></note>
