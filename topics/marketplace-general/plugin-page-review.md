[//]: # (title: Plugin page review)

After uploading a plugin to Marketplace, it will be manually reviewed by the Marketplace team. You will be contacted and asked to make changes if we find anything that doesn’t fit our guidelines. To speed up the review process, make sure the information you provide is complete and correct. Note that the plugin page requirements are subject to change, as the Marketplace is constantly evolving. Be prepared to adjust to new requirements as they come out.

<note><p>We may review published plugins at our discretion. We reserve the right to unpublish a plugin if an author rejects or doesn’t respond to our requests for adjustments.</p></note>

Below you can find the key requirements and tips for creating a plugin page.
