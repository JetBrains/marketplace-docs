[//]: # (title: Why build for JetBrains Marketplace?) 

JetBrains Marketplace allows third-party plugin developers to build and publish <control>free plugins</control> and make them available to the more than 10 million users of JetBrains products. They can also <control>sell plugins</control> while taking advantage of licensing and billing solutions provided by JetBrains. Our goal is to develop an ecosystem of high-quality extensions to JetBrains products and help you grow together with the Marketplace. If you donâ€™t have a clear idea of a plugin you want to develop, check the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin-ideas">Plugin Ideas</a> list and choose from the most requested features.
