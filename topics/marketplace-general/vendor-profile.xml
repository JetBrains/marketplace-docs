       id="vendor-profile">

    <p>A Vendor is an entity that publishes and represents plugins on the JetBrains Marketplace. You can upload a plugin as an individual vendor or an organization.</p>
    <p>If you are distributing plugins on behalf of some organization or plan to put your plugin on sales, you should create an <a href="organizations.xml">Organization entity</a>.</p>
    <p>Each plugin must be associated with one individual vendor or an organization. This requirement ensures that users can easily identify the vendor responsible for a plugin and understand their status (trader/non-trader), in compliance with the <a href="trader-status.xml">EU consumer protection rules</a>.</p>
    <p>Individual vendors and organizations will each have their own dedicated vendor pages where their plugins are listed, providing users with a centralized view.</p>
    <note>
        <p>The vendor name displayed in the Plugin Manager (in-product Marketplace) and web Marketplace is now obtained from the <a href="https://hub.jetbrains.com/users/c6d7fb22-8c47-45aa-aaaf-d056240e2f85">Hub account</a> (your Marketplace sign-in information). However, for the installed plugins, the vendor name will continue to be extracted from the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/plugin-configuration-file.html">plugin.xml</a> file.
