    <p>
        A <emphasis>Vendor</emphasis> is an entity that publishes and represents plugins on JetBrains Marketplace. You can upload a plugin as an individual vendor or an organization.
    </p>
    <p>If you distribute plugins on behalf of an organization or plan to sell them as an individual, you should create an <a href="organizations.xml">Organization entity</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Each plugin must be associated with a vendor or an organization. This requirement ensures that users can easily identify the vendor responsible for a plugin and understand their status (trader/non-trader), in compliance with the <a href="trader-status.xml">EU consumer protection rules</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Individual vendors and organizations each have their own dedicated vendor pages where their plugins are listed, providing users with a centralized view.
    </p>
    <note>
        <p>The vendor name displayed in the Plugin Manager and web Marketplace is now obtained from your <a href="https://hub.jetbrains.com/users/c6d7fb22-8c47-45aa-aaaf-d056240e2f85">Hub account</a>. However, for installed plugins, the vendor name will continue to be extracted from the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/plugin-configuration-file.html">plugin.xml</a> file.
