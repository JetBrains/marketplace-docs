       id="uploading-a-new-plugin">

    <note>
        <p>Please follow our <a href="plugin-overview-page.xml">recommendations</a> and make sure the plugin meets the <a
                href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/approval-guidelines">approval criteria
        </a> before you upload it.
        </p>
    </note>
    <p>The process of uploading a new plugin is quite simple:</p>
    <p>
        <list type="decimal">
            <li>Log in to JetBrains Marketplace.</li>
            <li>Open your user account menu, then select "Upload plugin":
                <img src="upload-plugin-button.png" alt="Upload a new plugin button" width="828"/>
            </li>
            <li>Fill in the fields in the Plugin Upload form to upload your new plugin:
                <img src="upload-plugin-form.png" alt="Upload a new plugin form" width="1128"/>
            </li>
        </list>
    </p>

    <p>
        <control>File size:</control>
        the maximum allowed plugin size is <control>300 MB</control>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <control>License:</control>
        You must provide your own end user license agreement with any Plugin via JetBrains Marketplace. We
        cannot tell you what your Plugin Developer EULA should say, but we can point you to <a
            href="https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">Open Source licenses
    </a> and various independent <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+eula+generator">EULA
        generators
    </a> that are not affiliated with JetBrains.
    </p>

    <p>
        <control>Tags:</control>
        When you upload a new plugin, please make sure to choose the correct tags, as they are used as search
        filters. Incorrect tags can lead to irrelevant search results and may impact the discoverability of your
        plugin.
    </p>

    <p>
        <control>Channels:</control>
        If you do not want your plugin to be generally available (e.g., it is an alpha/beta/EAP version), please
        add a <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/custom-release-channels.html">Custom
        Release Channel</a>.
    </p>
