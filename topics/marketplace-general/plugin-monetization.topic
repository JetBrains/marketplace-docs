    <chapter title="Business Models" id="business-models">
        <p>Please explore the following business models and select the one you'd like to proceed with.</p>
    <list>
        <li><control>Free:</control>
        <p>If you want to keep offering your plugin for free, you can still earn some money by accepting <a href="best-practices-for-listing.topic" anchor="how-to-add-donation-links">donations</a>. This approach can help you build a user base and establish your plugin's reputation. Users who find value in your work may support you voluntarily.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <control><a href="freemium.topic">Freemium:</a></control>
            <p>You can offer some features for free and offer a license to access all of the features. Users will be able to evaluate paid features during a 30-day trial period.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <control><a href="paid-plugins.topic">Paid:</a></control>
            <p>All plugin features will be available for paid users only. This model is suitable when you want to offer features that are not available for free, providing only a 30-day trial period and allowing users to evaluate a plugin before purchasing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><control>Externally paid:</control></p>
            <p>Access to plugin features is managed by the plugin vendorâ€™s own licensing solution. This model is applicable when plugin authors prefer to manage subscriptions and purchases through their own system.</p>
        </li>
    </list>

    <chapter title="Licensing Schemes" id="licensing-schemes">
        <p>The following licensing schemes are available:</p>
        <list>
            <li>
                <p>Yearly/Monthly Subscription <control>without</control> a Fallback License:</p>
                <p>Users will be able to use your plugin only if they have an active subscription. This model ensures a steady revenue stream as long as users maintain their subscriptions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Yearly/Monthly Subscription <control>with</control> a Fallback License:</p>
                <p>Users will get access to a specific plugin version for a lifetime, but updates are available only if they have an active subscription. This can be a way to provide long-term value to users and maintain their satisfaction even if they decide to cancel their subscription(s).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perpetual License:</p>
                <p>Users will pay once and will get access to your plugin updates for a lifetime. This model can be attractive to users who prefer to make a single payment and use the plugin indefinitely.</p>
