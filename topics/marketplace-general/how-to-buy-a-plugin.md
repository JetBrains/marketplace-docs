        <procedure>
              <p>All plugins come with a 30-day trial period, so you can test them out before buying a license:</p>
              <list type="decimal">
                   <li>Use the “Search” field in the <control>Plugin Manager</control> to find the plugin you want.</li>
                   <li><control>Install</control> the plugin and restart your IDE.
                   <note>You will need to restart the IDE every time you install a paid plugin. If you skip this step, the plugin will be disabled.</note>
                   </li>
                   <li>Activate the trial-period by selecting <control>“Evaluate for free”</control> in the license activation window that pops up.</li>
              </list>
        </procedure>

<p>You can make the purchase directly from your IDE (Plugin Manager) or through the Plugin page on JetBrains Marketplace:</p>
