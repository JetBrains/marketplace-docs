## Getting Help with JetBrains Marketplace

![Slack](slack.svg){width=25}{type="joined"} **Use the JetBrains Platform Slack:** Post your questions to the 
  [#marketplace](https://jetbrains-platform.slack.com/messages/C5U6ZNG20) channel. Keep in mind that it’s not an official 
  support channel, but a community of plugin developers and JetBrains employees.

![Forum](forum.svg){width=25}{type="joined"} **Community forum:** Check out topics in the 
  [Marketplace Paid Plugins](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/115000009284-Marketplace-Paid-Plugins) 
  or create a new one, and it will be handled by community members or the Marketplace Team.

![YouTrack](youtrack.svg){width=25}{type="joined"} **Issue Tracker:** To report a bug or request a feature, submit a new issue to the 
  [Marketplace YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=MP) with the corresponding type.

![Email](email.svg){width=25}{type="joined"} **Submit your request via email:** [marketplace@jetbrains.com](mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com).

**Marketplace documentation feedback:** If you are having trouble with the guide itself, such as missing, incorrect, 
  or confusing content, please raise an issue in the [Marketplace YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=MP&c=Type%20Task&c=Subsystem%20Docs). 
  If you want to report an issue for a specific page, use the “Was this page helpful” feedback form at the bottom of each 
  documentation page. To add feedback, click **No**, and the form will appear. Please try to be as specific as possible 
  and provide your email address in order to be notified about updates.
