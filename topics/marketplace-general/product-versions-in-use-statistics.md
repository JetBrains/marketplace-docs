[//]: # (title: Statistics: Product Versions in Use)

We are often asked by plugin developers which product versions should be supported by the plugin, as it is logical not to release plugin updates for all the product versions released to the market, but rather focus on the latest / the most used versions of the product.

Previously, plugin developers would have to analyze their plugins downloads by the IDE version, but for an easier overview, we are publishing statistics that will help you decide which versions of products to support on this page.     

The statistics for this page has been gathered in October 2019, but looking into the older statistics, it doesn't change much overtime.

In general, statistics show the following trends:

* It makes sense to support the latest major release, as well as at least two previous major releases (in this case, you are covering the majority of the users - on average, it's somewhat 80%.) This % doesn't change from product to product much.

* The latest version of the product is used by roughly 50% of the users (as it does take some time to upgrade to the latest version, especially in the companies.)

* The latest major release minus three major versions has less than 10% userbase.  

* The longer the product is on the market, the more significant is the portion of "Other versions" = versions older than "Latest major release -3" (which is logical, given that we used to have perpetual licenses and provide fallback licenses with our subscription offer.) In the meantime, there are no versions with a significant user base in the "Other versions" section.
