       title="How to anonymously and uniquely identify a user of a paid plugin?"
       id="identify-user-of-paid-plugin">

    <p>As a plugin developer, you may want to collect some usage statistics. You may also want to uniquely and
        anonymously identify users in order to make said statistics more precise and insightful.
    </p>

    <p>First of all, you must explicitly get user's consent for doing this. After that, you can add this code to your
        plugin:
    </p>

    <p>
        <code style="block" lang="java">
            final LicensingFacade instance=LicensingFacade.getInstance();
                    return instance==null?null:instance.getLicensedToMessage();
        </code>
    </p>

    <p>This code will return the <code>LicensedTo</code> value which is unique for a given user. It will be kept during
        the
        plugin's reinstallation and is also derived from the JetBrains Account. To make it anonymous you can hash the <code>
            LicensedTo
        </code> value and send only the hash.
    </p>
