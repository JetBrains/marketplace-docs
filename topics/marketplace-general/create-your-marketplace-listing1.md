[//]: # (title: Create Your Marketplace Listing)

The Marketplace plugin page is the webpage used for JetBrains Marketplace listings. It provides users with useful links and information about your pluginâ€™s functionality,  product compatibility, versions, and pricing (if applicable).  When you upload a plugin to JetBrains Marketplace, it becomes available to over 10 million users of JetBrains products. They can download, evaluate, and buy your plugin from the plugin page, as well as rate and review it.

A high-quality page is essential to attracting and engaging new customers, which will result in a higher number of downloads. So, it is important to prepare appropriate, high-quality content for the plugin page before uploading it to the Marketplace.
