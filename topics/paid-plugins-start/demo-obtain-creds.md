[//]: # (title: Obtain the credentials to access the Marketplace Demo instance)

You should have already received the credentials after [submitting a request](submit-a-request-to-sell-plugins-at-the-marketplace.md) to start selling your plugin. Please check your inbox for an email titled “*You have been granted access to the JetBrains Marketplace Sandbox*".

If you don’t have it, feel free to reach out to JetBrains via [marketplace@jetbrains.com](mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com) or [Slack](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/slack). You will get a separate email with username/password details.

<warning>
    <p>Make sure to change the password when you first sign in.</p>
</warning>

You need your credentials to access both the Marketplace Demo server and the Sales Systems Marketplace Demo. You will need to provide your credentials separately for both of these applications (it is normal if you are asked to re-provide your credentials when going from the plugins repository to the shop.)

<tip>
<p>Endpoints necessary for the IDE to function are open and don't require credentials to be accessed.</p>
