[//]: # (title: Notes on pricing)

Setting a price for your plugin might be a challenge, and we are working on an extensive Pricing Guide which can help you here, it should be published in Q2 2020.

For now, we have some limitations on JetBrains side you need to keep in mind when setting a price: 

*  The default sales price for an annual subscription can't be decimal. That also applies to 2nd year / 3rd year onwards discounts of 20% and 40% - an annual discounted price can't be decimal either. Should it become decimal as of our 2nd year / 3rd year onwards discounts calculations, we will be rounding it on our side.
