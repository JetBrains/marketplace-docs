       title="Obtain the credentials to access the JetBrains Marketplace Demo instance"
       id="demo-obtain-creds">

    <p>You should have already received the credentials after <a
            href="submit-a-request-to-sell-plugins-at-the-marketplace.xml">submitting a
        request
    </a> to start selling your plugin. Please check
        your
        inbox for an email titled <emphasis>“You have been granted access to JetBrains Marketplace
            Sandbox"</emphasis>.
    </p>

    <p>If you don’t have it, feel free to reach out to JetBrains via
        <a href="mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com">marketplace@jetbrains.com</a>
        or <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/slack">Slack</a>.
        You will get a separate email with username/password details.
    </p>

    <warning>
        <p>Make sure to change the password when you first sign in.</p>
    </warning>

    <p>You need your credentials to access both the
        <a href="https://master.demo.marketplace.intellij.net">JetBrains Marketplace Demo</a>
        server
        and the <a href="https://mp.jpf-demo.aws.intellij.net/login">Sales Systems Marketplace Demo</a>. You will need
        to provide
        your
        credentials separately for both of these applications (it is normal if you are asked to re-provide your
        credentials
        when going from the plugins repository to the shop.)
    </p>

    <tip>
        <p>Endpoints necessary for the IDE to function are open and don't require credentials to be accessed.</p>
