[//]: # (title: Create a Product Code)

After [submitting a request](submit-a-request-to-sell-plugins-at-the-marketplace.md) to sell plugins, you will be contacted by our vendor success team via email with further steps. One of these steps is to create a Product Code and provide it in the reply.

A Product Code is registered in the JetBrains Sales System and serves as a unique ID for all plugin-related sales operations. It also connects the Marketplace releases of the plugin to the Sales System.

Your Product Code must:

* Start with **P**.

* Be no shorter than **4** characters.

* Be no longer than **15** characters.

* **NOT** contain any numbers or special symbols.

* Contain only **CAPITAL LETTERS**.

For example, the Product Code for a plugin called “Make Me Coffee” should be *PMAKEMECOFFEE*.

        Please note that it is rather difficult to change a Product Code after it’s been created, as doing so requires merging a lot of financial information and transactions, and additionally maintaining legacy product code in our systems for reference and backward compatibility.

End-users will see the Product Code on the invoices, on the check-out page, and in their [JetBrains Accounts](https://account.jetbrains.com/).
