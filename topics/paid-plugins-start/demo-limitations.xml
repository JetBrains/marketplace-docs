                The JetBrains Marketplace Demo instance can be cleared from time to time. That is why some
                plugins/purchases might be removed. If you are affected by this, re-upload your plugin once again and
                contact
                our Support team via <a href="mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com">marketplace@jetbrains.com</a>.

                If you plan to test emails on the JetBrains Marketplace Demo instance, keep in mind that all emails are available
                to
                all testers. That is why we ask you to use it responsibly and don't use any confidential
                names/information
                there.
