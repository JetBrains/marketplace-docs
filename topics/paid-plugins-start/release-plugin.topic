                <p>Keep in mind that free community programs require an annual billing period. To enable it,

                    Optionally, you can adjust the trial period or disable it. The default trial period is 30 days. To
                    edit it click the <control>Edit Section</control> button near the <path>Trial Period</path> section:
                </p>
                <img src="trial-period.png" alt="Trial Period section" width="1308"/>
                <p>
                    You can then select the 7, 10, 14, 30 days periods or disable it:

                <p>
                    You can change the trial period at any time after the plugin is reviewed.
                </p>
                <note>
                    <p>
                        Users always get the number of trial days they requested. For example, if the trial period was 30
                        days, a user started it, but the next day you lower it to 7 days, that user will still have the 30 days of trial.

                    <p>
                        Take into account that trial period is shown correctly only in 2024.1 and later IDE versions.

                    Once these steps have been performed, we will review your plugin within two business days. You will
                    receive a
                    notification as soon as the status of the review changes or if there are any questions regarding the
                    approval of
                    your plugin.
