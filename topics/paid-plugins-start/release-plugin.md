[//]: # (title: 7. Release the Plugin)

After all the testing is done, you are ready to start sales of the plugin on the Marketplace.

1. Upload the plugin to the Marketplace (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/).

1. Create an [Organization](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/organizations.html) and transfer the plugin to this Organization.

1. Go to the Edit Organization and submit your banking information under the *Vendor information* tab.

1. When the previous steps are completed, you will see the `Add to Marketplace` button on the Sales Info tab. 
   If the plugin is ready to release, press this button and submit the `Add Plugin to Marketplace` form.

   Please be careful when filling out this form. If some fields are needed to be changed after submitting, please
   write to the Marketplace Team via [marketplace@jetbrains.com](mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com).
   
   Also note, that the release-version and release-paid are set in the `plugin.xml` file. 
   To change these values, reupload the plugin with new values.

1. We will start a release process. Usually, it takes 1 to 2 business days to 
   prepare the plugin for a release on JetBrains side (as we need to update all the sales and accountancy systems).
