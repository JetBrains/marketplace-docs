[//]: # (title: 7. Release the Plugin)

After all the testing is done, you are ready to start sales of the plugin on the Marketplace. Please contact the Marketplace team via email [marketplace@jetbrains.com](mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com) or Slack, and agree on the date.

Usually, it takes 2 to 5 business days to prepare the plugin for a release on JetBrains side (as we need to update all the sales and accountancy systems.) Please make sure that all the required information about pricing and other options has been passed to JetBrains on the previous step.
