[//]: # (title: Notes on information change)

Once we start sales of your plugin on the Marketplace, it will be extremely difficult to change the following information:

* Product Code.
* Plugin Name.

As these IDs are used in both sales and accountancy systems, we must keep track of all the names and codes changes and deploy them across a bunch of various documents and processes.

We want to encourage you to settle on the code and the name before the start of the sales, and reach out to the Marketplace team if you need to change, but we will be able to do it in exceptional cases only.

Other information about the plugin can be easily changed (most of it - as a self-service.)
