       title="Create a Product Code"
       id="obtain-a-product-code-from-jetbrains">

    <p>After <a href="submit-a-request-to-sell-plugins-at-the-marketplace.xml">submitting a request</a> to sell plugins,
        you will
        be
        contacted by our vendor success team via email with further steps. One of these steps is to create a Product
        Code
        and provide it in the reply.
    </p>

    <p>A <emphasis>Product Code</emphasis> is registered in the JetBrains Sales System and serves as a unique ID for all
        plugin-related sales
        operations. It also connects the JetBrains Marketplace releases of the plugin to the Sales System.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your Product Code must:
    </p>
    <p>
        <list>
            <li>
                Start with <b>P</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be no shorter than <b>4</b> characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be no longer than <b>15</b> characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>NOT</b> contain any numbers or special symbols.
            </li>
            <li>
                Contain only <b>CAPITAL LETTERS</b>.
            </li>
        </list>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the Product Code for a plugin called “Make Me Coffee” should be <b>PMAKEMECOFFEE</b>.
    </p>
    <warning>
        <p>
            Please note that it is rather difficult to change a Product Code after it’s been created, as doing so
            requires merging a lot of financial information and transactions, and additionally maintaining legacy
            product code in our systems for reference and backward compatibility.
        </p>
    </warning>
    <p>End-users will see the Product Code on the invoices, on the check-out page, and in their <a
            href="https://account.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains
        Accounts</a>.
