[//]: # (title: Marketplace Demo)

JetBrains' Marketplace and Business Application Development teams have prepared a fully-functioning Marketplace Demo instance for you, which can be used for testing the paid plugins marketplace in a safe and protected environment. It is always available and can be used to test the whole solution before releasing it to the public.

Just follow these steps to test your plugin:

1. [Obtain the credentials](demo-obtain-creds.md) to access the Marketplace Demo instance.
2. [Prepare an IDE](demo-prepare-ide.md) for tests with a Marketplace Demo environment.
3. Learn about [Marketplace Demo instance limitations](demo-limitations-1.md).
4. [Start testing](demo-start-test-1.md) on the Marketplace Demo instance.
