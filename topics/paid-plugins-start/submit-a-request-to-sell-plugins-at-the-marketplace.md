[//]: # (title: 1. Submit a request to sell plugins at the Marketplace)

The Marketplace has been launched in June 26th, 2019, and it is now in the early stage of the operations, that's why the process of setting up a new paid plugin on the Marketpalce requires assistance from JetBrains team to test the licensing solution together with the sales system and plugins repository.

Please submit the request via the [Apply to Marketplace form](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/marketplace/) or reach out to us via [marketplace@jetbrains.com](mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com) and we will be happy to assist you.
