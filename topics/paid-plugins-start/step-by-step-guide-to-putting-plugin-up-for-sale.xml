    <p>Keep in mind that you can test the plugin on our <a href="marketplace-demo.md">Marketplace Demo</a>  instance
        before
        uploading it. You will be able to go through the whole plugin release process and check how purchasing the
        plugin
        works. Moreover, you can make sure the plugin functions as intended and play around with plugin updates. If your
        plugin contains <a href="freemium.md">free functionality</a>, you can test the logic behind licensing checks.
