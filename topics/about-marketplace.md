[//]: # (title: JetBrains Marketplace)

Plugins extend the core functionality of JetBrains products. They provide various integrations (e.g., with a VCS or application servers), add support for different development technologies, frameworks and programming languages, and so on.

The Marketplace (AKA Plugins Repository) is a service responsible for:

* Providing a product (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA and other IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs) with a list of compatible plugins and their updates.
 
* Facilitating the download of compatible plugin updates.
 
* Storage, uploading, and management of the plugins and their updates developed and published by third-party vendors or JetBrains.

JetBrains provides an official plugins repository [plugins.jetbrains.com](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) for all IntelliJ Platform-based IDEs, as well as TeamCity, .NET, and Hub (with widgets support for YouTrack and Upsource.) It will be supporting [JetBrains Space](https://jetbrains.space) soon.

This documentation section includes articles, FAQs, and tutorials on [JetBrains Marketplace / Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) operations.

You can always reach out to the plugin repository team via email [plugins-admin@jetbrains.com](mailto:plugins-admin@jetbrains.com).
