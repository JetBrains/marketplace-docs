[//]: # (title: About JetBrains Marketplace)

JetBrains Marketplace is the next generation of the [Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com), turning it into a marketplace for third-party plugin developers to sell their plugins while taking advantage of licensing and billing solutions provided by JetBrains.

This documentation describes all the business and technical information about the marketplace focusing on the paid plugins.

You can find more information about the plugin development and plugin repository in general in [IntelliJ Platform SDK Documentation](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/).

Should you have any questions about the project, feel free to reach out to [marketplace@jetbrains.com](emailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com).
