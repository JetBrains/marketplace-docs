[//]: # (title: Marketplace EAP: who and why?)

Some time ago, to start with the Marketplace Early Access Program (AKA EAP), we have decided to reach out to existing paid plugin developers, and those who have shown interest in paid plugins development for JetBrains products. We wanted to present them with our plans and conditions of publishing plugins to the Marketplace, gather feedback, and modify JetBrains terms based on the review and our discussions.

At this moment, as the paid plugins support on the Marketplace is available, and the EAP is closed.

Marketplace team would like to say a huge **thank you** to all of our early adopters of the Marketplace for your participation, support, and feedback!
