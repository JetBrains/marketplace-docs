        is a method that utilizes competitor prices as a benchmark. You can use competitor-based
        pricing to adjust the cost-based price. Basically, you should look at the prices of similar products/plugins
        to decide your own price point.

                It might be close to what the market can reasonably sustain
            </td>
            <td>
                There is a risk of price wars (especially when supply exceeds demand)

        To estimate the competitor-based price, consider the following questions:
    </p>
    <p>
        <list>
            <li>
                Who are my competitors?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do they propose similar products/plugins?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do they offer more or fewer features?
            </li>
            <li>
                How do competitors price their products/plugins?
            </li>
            <li>
                How does the cost-based price for my product/plugin compare with the competitorsâ€™ offers?
            </li>
        </list>
    </p>
