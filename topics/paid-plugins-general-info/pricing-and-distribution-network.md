[//]: # (title: Pricing and Distribution Network)

## Pricing

Plugin vendor is setting the "standard price" aka "list price" (which is a monthly rate for a commercial license and personal license.) JetBrains calculates yearly price (which is equal to 10 monthly prices), upgrade, bulk purchase, personal license discount, etc based on the "standard price" set by the vendor (in this case the pricing model is consistent across JetBrains products and all third-party plugins), but a vendor can request the prices to be calculated in a different way. An example of how the prices are calculated: [https://www.jetbrains.com/store/](https://www.jetbrains.com/store/) (we'll provide more information on the actual formulas later.)

[//]: # (TODO provide more information on the formulas)

Currency and variable prices are introduced in the same way as for JetBrains own products (e.g. you can pay in GBP only if you're in the UK.) Prices for Paid Plugins are set in one of the following major currencies depending on the customer country: USD, EUR, GBP, CZK, JPY.

## Distribution Network - Resellers

JetBrains will utilize its [resellers network](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/partners/#profession=reseller) to make plugins available via the JetBrains distribution network (very important for some markets where direct sales are problematic.) Plugin vendor can opt-out from this option. 

In a case of selling a plugin via JetBrains' resellers, there will be an additional commission held by the reseller, and this reseller commission is paid from JetBrains commission (so the plugin developer always get a constant % of the plugin price.)

**(!)** Please note: in some cases, resellers can set their prices bigger than a regular list price set by the vendor and JetBrains doesn't control it.
