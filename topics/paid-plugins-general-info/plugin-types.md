[//]: # (title: Plugin types)

There are different types of plugins supported in the Marketplace:

* Free plugin - already available in the Plugins Repository since many years ago.

* Paid-via-JetBrains (revenue sharing model) - "Marketplace paid plugins" project is mostly about this kind of plugins (when the plugin is sold via JetBrains.)

* Paid-via-Vendor (no revenue sharing, third-party license keys) - possible before, no JetBrains involvement.
