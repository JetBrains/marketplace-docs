        </step>
        <step><p>
            Enter either a <control>Discount Value</control> or a <control>Free Period</control>. If you set a Free
            Period Discount, customers who apply
            this offer will be able to use your plugin for free during this period. If you set a Discount Value,
            customers can use this discount to purchase a monthly or annual subscription for your plugin (depending on
            the <control>Billing Period</control> you specify).
        </p></step>
        <step><p>
            (Optional) Specify an <control>End date</control> after which the coupons generated for this offer will
            expire. If you donâ€™t specify a
            <control>Billing Period</control>, the offer is available for both monthly and annual subscription types.
            You can also specify the
            <control>Countries</control>
            in which you want your offer to be available.
        </p></step>

        After submitting this form, your new offer will appear in the <path>Current Offers</path> section of the <path>
        Sales Info
    </path> tab
        where you can edit your offers, remove them, and generate coupons.
