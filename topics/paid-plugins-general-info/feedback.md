[//]: # (title: How do I provide feedback?)

We are looking forward to hearing back from you about our Marketplace project! We would be very glad to discuss terms and conditions of the Marketplace, as well as the technical solution.

We've set up a couple of channels to gather feedback on the Marketplace:

* Create a new topic in the [Marketplace Paid Plugins](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/115000009284-Marketplace-Paid-Plugins) community forums, and they will be handled by the Marketplace Team.

* Send an email to [marketplace@jetbrains.com](mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com).

* For legal documents: please review them on Google Docs (links shared in the [relevant article](legal-agreements.md)) and leave your comments and suggestions there (or in DOCX/PDF files and share them with us.)

* Feel free to reach out to us with questions and comments at any time!
