Software pricing is a complex and tricky topic. The price of a software product depends on a variety of factors such as development costs, competition, regional specifics, and others. There are 3 major pricing strategies that can be used to estimate your plugin price. It is recommended to consider all 3 approaches:

[**Cost-plus pricing**](cost-plus-pricing.md) can be used as a benchmark to validate the lowest price that you can consider.

[**Competitor-based pricing**](competitor-based-pricing.md) allows you to find out what competitors are charging.

[**Value-based pricing**](value-based-pricing.md) helps understand the maximum price customers are ready to pay.
