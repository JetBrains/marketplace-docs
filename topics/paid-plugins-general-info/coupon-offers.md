This form helps you generate single-use coupons for your customers.
![Offer Form](new_offer.png)

You should enter either a *Discount Value* or a *Free Period*. If you set a Free Period Discount, customers who apply this offer will be able to use your plugin for free during this period. If you set a Discount Value, customers can use this discount to purchase a monthly or annual subscription for your plugin (depending on the Billing Period you specify).

You can specify an *End date* after which the coupons generated for this offer will expire. If you don’t specify a *Billing Period*, the offer is available for both monthly and annual subscription types. You can also specify the *countries* in which you want your offer to be available.

After submitting this form, your new offer will appear in the **Current Offers** section of the sales info page where you can edit your offers, remove them, and generate coupons. Please note that if you remove an offer, all coupons associated with it will be invalidated.

## Generate coupons
To generate coupons for your customers, click the offer name in the offer section on the sales info page.
