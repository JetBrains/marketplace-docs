[//]: # (title: JetBrains Sales Systems - features for third-party plugins)

Plugins will be very similar to JetBrains own products regarding how JetBrains sales systems will treat them on the business logic level, which means that most of the sales processes available for JetBrains products will also be available for third-party plugins sold via JetBrains. We are going to support all standard approaches we have for JetBrains own products, such as:

* Evaluation licenses.

* Different means of payment.

* Quotes.

* Monthly/yearly subscriptions.

* Personal/Commercial subscriptions.

* Subscription Packs.

* Bulk purchase discounts (AKA volume discounts). *(NOT YET AVAILABLE)*

* Management via [JetBrains Account](https://account.jetbrains.com) (JBA).

* Community support (free for opensource/classroom/students/etc). *(NOT YET AVAILABLE)*

* Discounts. *(AVAILABLE VIA SALES REPRESENTATIVE NOW, TO BE AUTOMATED LATER)*

* etc.

Please see [https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb) to check JetBrains Sales FAQ and [this JBA-related section](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/categories/200934669-JetBrains-Account-Help), in particular, to familiarize yourself with JetBrains Account (JBA) which is JetBrains license management solution.

We're also going to make it possible to sell bundles with the IDE and co-term them with other subscriptions.
