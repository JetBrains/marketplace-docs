    ## Pricing

    Plugin vendor is setting the "standard price" aka "list price" (which is a monthly rate for a commercial license and
    personal license.) JetBrains calculates yearly price (which is equal to 10 monthly prices), upgrade, bulk purchase,
    personal license discount, etc. based on the "standard price" set by the vendor (in this case the pricing model is
    consistent across JetBrains products and all third-party plugins), but a vendor can request the prices to be
    calculated
    differently. An example of how the prices are
    calculated: [https://www.jetbrains.com/store/](https://www.jetbrains.com/store/) (we'll provide more information on
    the
    actual formulas later.)

    [//]: # (TODO provide more information on the formulas)

    Currency and variable prices are introduced in the same way as for JetBrains own products (e.g., you can pay in GBP
    only
    if you're in the UK.) Prices for Paid Plugins are set in one of the following major currencies depending on the
    customer
    country: USD, EUR, GBP, CZK, JPY.

    ## Distribution Network - Resellers

    JetBrains is utilizing
    its [resellers and distributors network](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/partners/#profession=reseller) to make
    plugins available via the JetBrains distribution network (crucial for some markets where direct sales are
    problematic.)
    Plugin vendors can opt-out from this option.

    In a case of selling a plugin via JetBrains' resellers, there will be an additional commission held by the reseller,
    and
    this reseller commission is paid from JetBrains commission (so the plugin developer always get a constant % of the
    plugin price.)

    **(!)** Please note: in some cases, resellers can set their prices higher than a regular list price set by the
    vendor,
    and JetBrains doesn't control it.
