    <p>Vendors of paid plugins may provide special subscription and pricing offers for different types of individuals
        and organizations (student, open-source, etc.), in alignment with JetBrainsâ€™ special offers. You can learn more
        about the terms and apply to get special status for your account <a
                href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#discounts">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have a <a href="https://account.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains Account</a> status eligible for the offer, you
        can find
        offers available for specific plugins on the dedicated plugin pricing page. To apply for a particular offer:

                check if the
                email matches the one for the Marketplace account. You can find the email associated with the
