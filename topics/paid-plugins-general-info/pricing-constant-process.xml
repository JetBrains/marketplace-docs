       title="Pricing as a Constant Process"
       id="pricing-constant-process">

    <p>As the market evolves, products grow, and the competition intensifies, the price needs to be revised and adjusted
        to align better with new conditions.
    </p>

    <p>However, we should remember that every change in price, especially in a subscription one, can trigger a negative
        attitude or boost customer churn. When making a pricing change, it is important to communicate why. Ideally,
        communicate the upcoming changes weeks or even months in advance.
