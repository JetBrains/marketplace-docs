[//]: # (title: Will other IDEs built on top of IntelliJ Platform support paid plugins?)

JetBrains plans to scale the Marketplace solution to any non-JetBrains IDEs built on top of IntelliJ Platform (e.g. Android Studio). We are not limiting availability of the Marketplace to JetBrains tools only, so if the IDE built on top of IntelliJ Platform keeps the plugins repository / marketplace functionality from the platform, it will work the same way as with JetBrains products. 

Please note that free / community / educational versions of IDEs are not supported yet, so it will require a bit more time to bring paid plugins there - those products lack licensing mechanisms altogether right now.

We are working on the technical solution to support other non-JetBrains IDEs built on top of IntelliJ Platform, please stay tuned!
