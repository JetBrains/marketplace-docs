[//]: # (title: Competitor-Based Pricing)

Competitor-Based Pricing is a method that utilizes competitor prices as a benchmark. You can use competitor-based pricing to adjust the cost-based price. Basically, you should look at the prices of similar products / plugins to decide your own price point.

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| -------- | -------- |
| Simple, easy to use | Lack of your own pricing strategy that would take into consideration the peculiarities of your business |
| It might be close to what the market can reasonably sustain | There is a risk of price wars (especially when supply exceeds demand)|

To estimate the competitor-based price, consider the following questions:
* Who are my competitors?
* Do they propose similar products / plugins?
* Do they offer more or fewer features?
* How do competitors price their products / plugins?
* How does the cost-based price for my product / plugin compare with the competitorsâ€™ offers?
