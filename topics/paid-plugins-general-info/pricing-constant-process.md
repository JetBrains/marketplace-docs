[//]: # (title: Pricing as a Constant Process)

As the market evolves, products grow, and the competition intensifies, the price needs to be revised and adjusted to align better with new conditions.

However, we should remember that every change in price, especially in a subscription one, can trigger a negative attitude or boost customer churn. When making a pricing change, it is important to communicate why. Ideally, communicate the upcoming changes weeks or even months in advance.
