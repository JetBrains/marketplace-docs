[//]: # (title: Revenue sharing and JetBrains fee for plugins sold via Marketplace)

If the plugin is sold & licensed via JetBrains, a revenue sharing model is applied.

The *rake* (commission on plugin purchase via JetBrains, "100%-rake%" is known as a *Developer Fee*) is a % of a plugin sale price charged by JetBrains (deducted from the sale price before transferring money to the plugin developer) for its services, and it's set to the following amount:

* **5% for the first year from the launch of the marketplace** (*promo period* - the reduced fee which covers only part of JetBrains expenses. The fee is reduced for the first year to support the first vendors adopting JetBrains Marketplace). As the support for paid plugins on the Marketplace has been released on June 26th, 2019, this % will be applied until June 30th, 2020 (23:59:59 CEST).

* **15% after the first year since the marketplace paid plugins launch passed.** This % will be applied from July 1st, 2020 (00:00:00 CEST), as the paid plugins support at the Marketplace has been launched on June 26th, 2019.

As of the developer agreement, the commission can be changed with one-month notice, but it never can be more than 25%. Later on, we'd like to reduce the commission for high-revenue plugins - we've provided a clause to define a "custom formula" based on individual negotiations.

There will be no additional "marketplace developer fee" or "subscription fee" for getting an access to the marketplace for vendors, but we'll review all the vendors who would like to join the program.

## Pricing/fee calculations in regards to taxes and distribution channels

We always calculate the plugin developer fee from the list price (= the price you have set as the price we need to sell the plugin for), so you will always get 100%-rake% as your plugin developer commission.

If there are any additional taxes (e.g. VAT, WHT, etc) involved in the sale to the end-user (either personal or commercial), the tax is calculated on top of the list price. After that, the collected tax is settled with the respective government tax office. As neither JetBrains nor plugin developer is entitled to get these tax money collected, it is not a part of the fee calculation.

If there are any partner / reseller / distributor commissions involved, they are paid from JetBrains commission, not from plugin developer commission.
