    <procedure style="steps" title="Create a new offer">
        <step>
            Open the <path>Sales Info</path> tab of your plugin page.
        </step>
        <step>

        </step>
        <step>
            Enter a name and (optionally) a description for the new offer in the opened form.

        </step>
        <step>
            Enter either a <control>Discount Value</control> or a <control>Free Period</control>. If you set a Free
            Period Discount, customers who apply
            this offer will be able to use your plugin for free during this period. If you set a Discount Value,
            customers can use this discount to purchase a monthly or annual subscription for your plugin (depending on
            the <control>Billing Period</control> you specify).
        </step>
        <step>
            (Optional) Specify an <control>End date</control> after which the coupons generated for this offer will
            expire. If you donâ€™t specify a
            <control>Billing Period</control>, the offer is available for both monthly and annual subscription types.
            You can also specify the
            <control>Countries</control>
            in which you want your offer to be available.
        </step>
    </procedure>
    <p>
        After submitting this form, your new offer will appear in the <path>Current Offers</path> section of the <path>
        Sales Info
    </path> tab
        where you can edit your offers, remove them, and generate coupons.
    </p>
    <warning>
        <p>
            If you remove an offer, all coupons associated with it will be invalidated.
        </p>
