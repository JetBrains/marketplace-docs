       title="Pricing Perception Highlights"
       id="pricing-perception-highlights">

    <p>Consumer psychology influences how companies set their prices. Below are some behavioral insights that are worth
        considering while pricing a product or service:
    </p>
    <p>
        <list>
            <li>
                A highly priced product often generates a greater perceived value and can potentially attract more
                buyers.
            </li>
            <li>
                A low-priced product can turn off customers, who will perceive it as less valuable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simply having more than one pricing option, particularly when one seems very expensive, can drive
                customers to pay
                for the more affordably priced option.
            </li>
            <li>
                People associate ‘charm’ prices, which end in 9 with discounts and better deals (e.g $10.9).
            </li>
            <li>
                People perceive prices to be smaller when they contain fewer syllables.
            </li>
            <li>
                Buyers pay more money when prices are specific (e.g. $36.6 vs $31).
            </li>
            <li>
                Round prices (e.g., $100) are processed fluently, whereas non-rounded prices (e.g. $98.7) are processed
                slower.
            </li>
        </list>
