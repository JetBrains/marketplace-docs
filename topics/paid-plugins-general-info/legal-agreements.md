[//]: # (title: Legal Agreements)

To support the Marketplace operations from the legal side, JetBrains is going to introduce the following agreements:

## 1. Developer Agreement - JetBrains Marketplace

This is an agreement between a plugin developer (or plugin vendor) and JetBrains covering all aspects of publishing the plugin to the Marketplace and (optionally) selling it via JetBrains. This document includes all terms and conditions related to business between the vendor (developer) and JetBrains. There are some technical details to be provided closer to the release (marked in yellow).

This agreement must be signed (on the website, no physical copy) before the plugin is uploaded. It includes terms and conditions for non-marketplace developer-related matters as well.

The document is attached to the article. Alternatively, you can leave comments in the Google Document version of the document. Please don't share the link, your comments are visible to other Marketplace EAP participants and JetBrains employees, feel free to create a copy and send it to us if you want to keep comments in secret. Please review the document and share your feedback.

## 2. Marketplace Plugin Approval Guidelines

This is a guideline for approval of the plugins, updates and related assets. It's referenced from the Developer Agreement - JetBrains Marketplace and is going to be applied towards all plugins (both paid and free). It's already used as an internal document for our plugin moderation team.

The document is attached to the article. Alternatively, you can leave comments in the Google Document version of the document. Please don't share the link, your comments are visible to other Marketplace EAP participants and JetBrains employees, feel free to create a copy and send it to us if you want to keep comments in secret. Please review the document and share your feedback.
 
And these agreements are already in place (they are covering the Marketplace / paid plugins already):

## Terms of Use - JetBrains Marketplace

This is a general document covering everything that happens on the JetBrains Marketplace resources (the main resource is a plugins repository: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/). It's provided in addition to JetBrains general Terms of Use and expands it with marketplace-related terms. It's applicable to everyone using the marketplace (both to end-users and developers uploading/selling plugins).

You can find a document here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/terms-of-use

As of May 24th, 2019, we have updated the terms of use, and they will be published online shortly. The document is attached to the article. Alternatively, you can leave comments in the Google Document version of the document. Please don't share the link, your comments are visible to other Marketplace EAP participants and JetBrains employees, feel free to create a copy and send it to us if you want to keep comments in secret. Please review the document and share your feedback.

## Privacy Policy

This is a unified document for all JetBrains web resources, it applies to the Marketplace, too: https://www.jetbrains.com/company/privacy.html

## Purchasing Terms

This document includes payment terms, ways of product delivery, order placement and acceptance, how we manage personal data during the purchase, etc, and it covers products sold via the Marketplace, too: https://www.jetbrains.com/store/terms/ (it's unified document for all purchases from JetBrains, already includes all the necessary Marketplace provisions).
