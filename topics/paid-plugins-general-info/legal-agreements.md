[//]: # (title: Legal Agreements)

To support the Marketplace operations from the legal side, JetBrains has the following agreements in place:

## 1. JetBrains Marketplace Developer Agreement

It is an agreement between a plugin developer (or plugin vendor) and JetBrains covering all aspects of publishing the plugin to the Marketplace and (optionally) selling it via JetBrains. This document includes all terms and conditions related to business between the vendor (developer) and JetBrains.

You can find a document here: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/developer-agreement](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/developer-agreement)

This agreement must be signed (on the website, no physical copy) before the plugin is uploaded. It includes terms and conditions for non-marketplace developer-related matters as well.

The document is attached to the article. Alternatively, you can leave comments in the [Google Document version of the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noU7fAKbd9mmHHWelP1bsuH21st0n9kfZaPtQxL0bdE/edit). Your comments are going to be visible to other viewers and JetBrains employees, feel free to create a copy and send it to us if you want to keep comments in secret.

## 2. JetBrains Plugin Marketplace Approval Guidelines

It is a guideline for approval of the plugins, updates, and related assets. It's referenced from the JetBrains Marketplace Developer Agreement and is applied towards all plugins (both paid and free.)

You can find a document here: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/approval-guidelines](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/approval-guidelines) 

The document is attached to the article. Alternatively, you can leave comments in the [Google Document version of the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ls1qpMbUTLVjwLq5RHu6RVHrQ9vvLwSOeE-g88eJJs/edit). Your comments are going to be visible to other viewers and JetBrains employees, feel free to create a copy and send it to us if you want to keep comments in secret.

##  3. JetBrains Plugin Marketplace Agreement

It is a general document covering everything that happens on the JetBrains Marketplace resources (the main resource is a plugin repository: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/)). It's provided in addition to JetBrains general [Terms of Use](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/useterms.html) and expands it with marketplace-related terms. It applies to everyone using the marketplace (both to end-users and developers uploading/selling plugins).

You can find a document here: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/terms-of-use](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/terms-of-use)

If you are using the Marketplace from Russia, [Terms of Use (JetBrains Distributions s.r.o.)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/ru-terms-of-use) apply instead of the standard Terms of Use.

The documents are attached to the article. Alternatively, you can leave comments in the Google Document versions of the documents ([JetBrains Plugin Marketplace Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xw24DYnDunbxm3lDZjB7F0ZgjPDDhyWMA4be8d41V0I/edit), [JetBrains Plugin Marketplace Agreement (JetBrains Distributions s.r.o.)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sXeR5y3bIgrpX2Yu2mq_6LfYXD8ofxRBt7ZFvGn6MV4/edit)). Your comments are going to be visible to other viewers and JetBrains employees, feel free to create a copy and send it to us if you want to keep comments in secret.

## 4. Privacy Policy

It is a unified document for all JetBrains web resources, it applies to the Marketplace, too: [https://www.jetbrains.com/company/privacy.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/privacy.html)

## 5. Purchasing Terms

This document includes payment terms, ways of product delivery, order placement and acceptance, how we manage personal data during the purchase, etc., and it covers products sold via the Marketplace, too: [https://www.jetbrains.com/store/terms/](https://www.jetbrains.com/store/terms/) (it's unified document for all purchases from JetBrains, already includes all the necessary Marketplace provisions.)
