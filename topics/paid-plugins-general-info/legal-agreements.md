[//]: # (title: Legal Agreements)

[//]: # (TODO CHECK LINKS)

To support the Marketplace operations from the legal side, JetBrains has the following agreements in place:

## 1. JetBrains Marketplace Developer Agreement

This is an agreement between a plugin developer (or plugin vendor) and JetBrains covering all aspects of publishing the plugin to the Marketplace and (optionally) selling it via JetBrains. This document includes all terms and conditions related to business between the vendor (developer) and JetBrains.

You can find a document here: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/developer-agreement](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/developer-agreement)

This agreement must be signed (on the website, no physical copy) before the plugin is uploaded. It includes terms and conditions for non-marketplace developer-related matters as well.

The document is attached to the article. Alternatively, you can leave comments in the [Google Document version of the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10JbQSVWc1SJC6AWNxFz2FCOxDBASmDzG9xki6-QCoto/edit). Your comments are going to be visible to other viewers and JetBrains employees, feel free to create a copy and send it to us if you want to keep comments in secret.

## 2. JetBrains Plugin Marketplace Approval Guidelines

This is a guideline for approval of the plugins, updates and related assets. It's referenced from the JetBrains Marketplace Developer Agreement and is applied towards all plugins (both paid and free.)

##  3. JetBrains Plugin Marketplace Agreement

This is a general document covering everything that happens on the JetBrains Marketplace resources (the main resource is a plugins repository: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/). It's provided in addition to JetBrains general [Terms of Use](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/useterms.html) and expands it with marketplace-related terms. It's applicable to everyone using the marketplace (both to end-users and developers uploading/selling plugins).

## 5. Purchasing Terms
