    <p>The use of the plugin <b>will be covered by the EULA between plugin author/vendor and an end-user, there is no
        EULA
        between JetBrains and end-user on third-party plugins</b>.
    </p>

    <p>You must provide your own end user license agreement (known as <emphasis>Developer EULA</emphasis>) with any
        Plugin via
        JetBrains
        Marketplace. Developer EULA must, at a minimum, include terms consistent with, and at least as protective of
        JetBrains as the terms in the Standard EULA. The Standard EULA cannot be used instead of your Developer EULA,
        unless
        you make the necessary modifications to it to adjust it to your needs.
    </p>

    <p>The Developer EULA must specify, among other things, that you are the licensor of your Plugins and that JetBrains
        is not a party to Developer EULA.
    </p>

    <p>JetBrains will be acting as a reseller taking money for third-party plugins and will be transferring all sale
        revenue (holding JetBrains commission) to the plugin vendor.
    </p>

    <p>The current version of the Standard EULA from the <a
            href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/developer-agreement">JetBrains Marketplace Developer
        Agreement</a>:

    </p>
    <p>
        The Standard EULA (End User License Agreement) displayed below is primarily intended as an example of a EULA to
        accompany your Plugins. It cannot be used without necessary modifications. Using your own EULA or similar
        license
        agreement granting rights to users of your Plugin is recommended. Provision of this Standard EULA does not
        constitute legal advice; advice from a qualified attorney is required. If you use the wording presented below in
        the
        Standard EULA, you acknowledge that JetBrains is not liable for its use by you in any way and that you have to
        modify it to suit your individual needs.
