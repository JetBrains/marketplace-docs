[//]: # (title: Discounts and Offers)

Discounts and offers can help boost your plugin sales. It can attract more people to your plugin and encourage repeat customers. That’s why we’d like to draw your attention to these features and highlight the types of offers you can create:

<chapter title="Special offers"
id="special-offers"
initial-collapse-state="collapsed"
hide-from-structure="true"
level="3"><procedure>Custom offers and coupons that you can manage yourself. See <a href="coupon-offers.md">this article</a> for more information.</procedure> 
</chapter>

<chapter title="Global offers"
id="global-offers"
initial-collapse-state="collapsed"
hide-from-structure="true"
level="3"><procedure>A discount or special offer that will be available globally. To create such an offer, please send a request to <a href="mailto:marketplace@jetbrains.com">marketplace@jetbrains.com</a>.</procedure>
</chapter>

Third-party plugins can be included in JetBrains Global or Local campaigns, like the 20% discount for an uninterrupted subscription for the second year, a 40% discount for an uninterrupted subscription for the third year, and so on. However, every plugin developer can choose whether or not to participate in these campaigns.
