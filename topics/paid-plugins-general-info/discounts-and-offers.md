[//]: # (title: Discounts and Offers)

Unless opted-out, third-party plugins will be a part of all JetBrains Global or Local campaigns (discounts), but JetBrains will be notifying every plugin developer in advance to check the interest.

You will also have an opportunity to manage plugin-wide offers on your own, such as:

* Coupon offers.

* Global offers.

Right now the discounts and offers support for plugin developers is not implemented as a self-service, so in order to generate coupons and create discounts, please reach out to us via [marketing@jetbrains.com](mailto:marketing@jetbrains.com) or via Slack.
