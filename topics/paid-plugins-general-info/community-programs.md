[//]: # (title: Special Community Offers)

Vendors of paid plugins may provide special subscription and pricing offers for different types of individuals and organizations (student, open-source, etc.), in alignment with JetBrainsâ€™ special offers. You can learn more about the terms and apply to get special status for your account [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#discounts). 
Once you have a [JetBrains Account](https://account.jetbrains.com/) status eligible for the offer, you can find offers available for specific plugins on the dedicated plugin pricing page. To apply for a particular offer:
1. Log in to the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/) with this account or check if the email matches the one for the Marketplace account. You can find the email associated with the Marketplace account [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/author/me/).
2. Go to the Pricing tab on the Plugin page (press the Buy button in the upper right-hand corner).
3. Pick the most suitable discount from the available discounts dropdown list, and the price will automatically be adjusted.
