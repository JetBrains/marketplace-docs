[//]: # (title: Current status of the Marketplace project)

The Marketplace has been released on June 26th, 2019, and is now fully operational.

There are some important conditions applied right now:

* Only paid versions of IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs are supported (support for Community and Educational editions is coming very soon.)

* Only *Subscription* and *Subscription with Fallback* license types are supported (no perpetual licensing model available so far.)

* Right now sales via resellers are not available - we are setting up legal framework and technical solution to provide it in the nearest future.

* Right now special programs (Open Source, Education, etc) for plugins are not available - we are working on changes to our current programs workflow, it'll be available in the nearest future.
