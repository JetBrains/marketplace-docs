[//]: # (title: Current status of the Marketplace project)

The Marketplace [has been released](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2019/06/jetbrains-marketplace-is-live/) on June 26th, 2019, and is now fully operational.

There are some important conditions applied right now:

* Only *Subscription* and *Subscription with Fallback* license types are supported (no perpetual licensing model available so far.)

* Right now special programs (Open Source, Education, etc.) for plugins are not available out-of-the-box - we are working on changes to our current programs workflow. It'll be available in the nearest future. For now, you will be able to request free licenses to be issued to education institutions, students, user groups, open-source, but it is now a manual process.

As of the [JetBrains 2019 Annual Highlights Report](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/annualreport/2019/), approximately $130,000 USD has gone back into supporting plugin developers in the 2019 year after the Marketplace launch.
