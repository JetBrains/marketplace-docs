[//]: # (title: What types of licenses are supported?)

We are going to support the same types of licenses as JetBrains products licenses:

* Commercial licenses (business and organizations.)

* Personal licenses (individual customers.)

* Trial licenses (30-day trial.)

* Extended evaluation licenses (~90 days evaluation by request to the sales team.)

* Free licenses: (as a part of [community support program](https://www.jetbrains.com/support/community/))

    * Open-source licenses.

    * Student & Teacher licenses.

    * Classroom licenses.

    * Licenses issued to user groups, events, and other special licenses (MVP, Java Champions.)

You will be able to opt-out from free licenses (in this case, we won't be able to promote the plugin via our community support program.)
