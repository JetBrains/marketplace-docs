[//]: # (title: Value-Based Pricing)

The goal of value-based pricing is to figure out how much your potential customers are willing to pay for a product / plugin.

Instead of looking inwardly at your costs, or towards your competitors, with value-based pricing this time you look outward. You go out and ask your potential customers what value they see in your product.

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| -------- | -------- |
| The price reflects customers’ willingness to pay | It takes time to gather information from customers |
| You get to know your customers | The value-based price might not fully consider your costs |

Overall, there are two major ways that a product or service can create value for customers: 
* It helps increase customers’ revenue
    * by increasing the number of their paying users 
    * by increasing the customer retention rate 
    * by increasing the average revenue per customer
* It helps decrease customers’ expenses
    * by saving their costs 
    * by saving their time
    
Consider answering these questions to understand how much value your product or service creates for your customers:
* What pain points will the customer solve with a product / plugin? 
* What product / plugin feature is the least valuable for the customer?
* What product / plugin feature is the most valuable for the customer?
* What is the price that a customer wants to pay for the product / plugin?
* What is the price that a customer is willing to pay for the product / plugin?

It is also worth checking your potential customers’ price sensitivity by asking these questions:

* At what price would the customer consider the product too expensive?	
* At what price would the customer consider the product to be so cheap that they would not consider it?
* At what price would the customer consider the product to start to get expensive?
* At what price would the customer consider the product to be a ‘good value’?
