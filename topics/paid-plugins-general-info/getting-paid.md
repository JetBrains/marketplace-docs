[//]: # (title: How plugin developers / vendors are paid?)

Plugin developers / vendors are paid following the rules defined in the [Developer Agreement](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/legal/developer-agreement):

* Up to 30 days after the end-of-the-month (so that all credit cards/etc. settlement periods pass before the payment.)

* Paid to the bank account (unless agreed otherwise e.g., PayPal.)

* Paid only when it's more than 200$ to limit the number of transactions, paid on 31st December of every year even if it's less than 200$.

* Paid upon a self-billing invoice issued by JetBrains (so that you don't need to generate it yourself every time, please see Developer Agreement for more information.)

* Paid in US Dollars (unless agreed otherwise.)
