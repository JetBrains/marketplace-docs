[//]: # (title: What licensing scheme plugins can choose?)

The following licensing schemes are supported:

* Yearly/monthly subscription with a fallback license (similar to JetBrains Toolbox model, see this article about the fallback license: [https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207240845-What-is-perpetual-fallback-license-](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207240845-What-is-perpetual-fallback-license-).)

* Yearly/monthly subscription without a fallback license (can use the product only when there is an active subscription.)

JetBrains has switched to subscription model a few years back, please refer to [this blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2015/09/18/final-update-on-the-jetbrains-toolbox-announcement/) for more information why we have switched to the subscription model.

The following scheme is not yet implemented: 

* Perpetual license (one-time payment for the first version of the plugin, getting all the updates within the year, then paying for the upgrade, similar to TeamCity model or old JetBrains desktop-based tools model.)
