[//]: # (title: What JetBrains products support paid plugins?)

We will be rolling out the in-product support for the Marketplace in the following order:

* IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs (all paid IDEs including Rider) - **READY**

* IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs (free editions - community and educational) - **IN PROGRESS, WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON**

* .NET (ReSharper platform plugins) - no estimates yet.

* TeamCity - no estimates yet.

* Hub / Upsource / YouTrack - no estimates yet.

Each step will require some time to develop in-product support for the solution.
