[//]: # (title: What JetBrains products support paid plugins?)

We will be rolling out the in-product support for the Marketplace in the following order:

* IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs (all paid IDEs including Rider) - **READY**

* IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs (free editions - Community and Educational editions) - **READY**
(please note that third-party IDEs based on the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition e.g., Android Studio, is also supported. You can find more info in the following article: [do other IDEs built on top of IntelliJ Platform support paid plugins?](other-ides-support.md))

* Space - until the end of the year 2020.

* .NET (ReSharper platform plugins) - no estimates yet.

* TeamCity - no estimates yet.

* Hub / Upsource / YouTrack - no estimates yet.

Each step will require some time to develop in-product support for the solution.
