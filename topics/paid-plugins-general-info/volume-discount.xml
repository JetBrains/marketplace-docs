       title="Volume Discounts"
       id="reviews-policy">
    <p>Offering discounts for larger purchases motivates customers to buy more. It also shows appreciation to repeat or high-volume customers, encouraging them to continue purchasing plugin licenses. While providing a volume discount is entirely up to the vendor, we highly recommend at least considering this option for your plugin sales.
    </p>

    <note>
        <p>
            These discounts can apply to <control>organization</control> licenses only. Keep in mind that previous licenses that the organization bought will also be eligible for the discount.
        </p>
    </note>
    <p>
        To add volume discounts, navigate to the <emphasis>Sales</emphasis> tab on your plugin page, locate the <emphasis>Volume Discounts</emphasis> section, and click <emphasis>Add Volume Discounts</emphasis>:

    <p>You can specify the range of licenses and the corresponding discount for that quantity. For example, for purchases of at least 10 licenses, apply a discount of 5%</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that you can create up to three rules to offer different discounts for different license quantities:</p>

    <p>For organizations, the discount information will be shown on the <emphasis>Pricing</emphasis> tab:</p>
