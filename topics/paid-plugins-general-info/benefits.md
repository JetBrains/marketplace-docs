[//]: # (title: Benefits of the JetBrains Marketplace)

## For Plugin Developers

* Developers and plugin vendors can focus on the plugin development. Delegating license management and billing to JetBrains means that plugin vendors don't need to develop their custom license management solution (or purchase an external solution), and build a distribution channel.

* Developers can market their plugins to a huge and relevant user base of JetBrains (more than 6,000,000 users.)

    * JetBrains will be assisting paid plugin developers with marketing and positioning of their plugins.

* JetBrains provides additional protection (both from licensing management and billing processing sides).

* [JetBrains Account](https://account.jetbrains.com/) and other parts of JetBrains infrastructure provide end-users a way to purchase plugins and manage licenses much easier (and using a method they are already used to), which leads to more sales of the plugin.

* JetBrains provides sales support to end-users, as well as all sales-related communications (e.g., follow-ups) and management of community programs (open source, classroom, startups, students, etc.)

* Access to [JetBrains-authorized Resellers and Distributors](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/partners/#profession=reseller) all around the world.

* Revenue reports and analysis on JetBrains side.

* Additional in-product and plugin repository promotion of the plugin (subject to availability and heavily depends on the quality of the plugin and fit to the audience we are promoting it to.)

    * Increased priority to become a "featured plugin" in the IDE and on the plugins repository web site.

    * (possibly, no specifics yet) Additional promotion of the plugin from JetBrains side.

* Additional value programs:

    * Marketing support (quite flexible, and some examples are listed below):

        * JetBrains will generally be assisting paid plugin developers with marketing and positioning of their plugins.

        * JetBrains team will review individual plugin marketing strategy (and their marketing assets) and will tailor it to JetBrains audience.

        * JetBrains will integrate paid plugins into its marketing strategy (promoting on the website, publishing blog posts about the plugins, doing joint webinars on JetBrains platform, sharing information on the conferences we visit with a booth, etc.)

        * JetBrains marketing & sales teams will collaborate on up-selling the plugin to some of the current customers (e.g. via email blasts, special landing pages, etc.) when they see a demand and when possible legally (FYI there are some legal limitations on up-selling third-party tools, so a lot of conditions apply.)

        * Providing some of the marketing instruments we use (e.g., sending newsletters to customers having a plugin, release newsletters, lead nurturing, advertisement set up, etc.)

        * Help with PR - getting some extra exposure to promote plugins and the marketplace via various channels we have access to.

        * The possibility of creating short-term or long-term "soft bundles" - IDE+plugin for a fixed price (subject to negotiations, depends on JetBrains and plugin vendor business interests.)

    * Testing.

        * More testing for paid plugins.

    * Additional technical support.

    * "Verified publishers" program.

## What are the significant benefits for existing paid plugin vendors?

We find the following benefits to be of the highest priority for existing paid plugin vendors (keeping in mind that they already invested into their custom or external licensing solution, as well as payment processing):

* Developers can market their plugins to a huge and relevant user base of JetBrains (more than 6,000,000 users.)

* [JetBrains Account](https://account.jetbrains.com/) and other parts of JetBrains infrastructure provide end-users a way to purchase plugins and manage licenses much easier (and using a method they are already used to), which leads to more sales of the plugin.

* Marketing and promotion activities (read a list above.)

* Access to [JetBrains-authorized Resellers and Distributors](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/partners/#profession=reseller) all around the world.

In addition to that, there are some more tricky parts of the whole deal e.g.

* JetBrains is a global company which (in addition to developing great tools) takes a good care of the business side of the story, too. That means that all the complexity of taxation and legal operation in countries of end-user residence is automatically scaled to your plugins sales from JetBrains operations. There are dozens of examples like that - correct VAT collection, correct invoices, payment receipts, registration as a taxpayer, sanction lists for individuals/companies, etc.

* As we operate on a large scale, we need to make sure that our users all around the world have an access to our tools, so we introduce non-standard payment systems to match users' expectations in terms of local payments (e.g. Sofort payments in Germany, SEPA all around Europe, WeChat/Alipay/UnionCard in China, etc.)

## For End-users

* End-users will get an additional value using paid plugins from third-party developers.

* Security / Privacy Protection (no need to provide credit card and other data to the external entity on plugin purchase.)

* The easier plugin installs, payments, sign-ups, and management via JBA ([JetBrains Account](https://account.jetbrains.com).)

* It's closely associated with JetBrains and JetBrains Products.

* Easy-to-use licenses via JBA, management of all subscriptions/licenses via JBA, license server.

* Co-terming of licenses with JetBrains product licenses.

* Various discounts (e.g., volume), special licenses (User Group, Opensource, etc.), and other (already known to them) programs supported by JetBrains.

* Paid plugins sold via JetBrains are strictly conforming to JetBrains Marketplace Vendor Agreement which provides additional protection and guarantees for end-users.
