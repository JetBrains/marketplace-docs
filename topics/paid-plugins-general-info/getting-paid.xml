        <list>
            <li>
                Up to 30 days after the end-of-the-month (so that all credit cards/etc. settlement periods pass before

            </li>
            <li>

                of every year even if it's less than 200$.
            </li>
            <li>
                Paid upon a self-billing invoice issued by JetBrains (so that you don't need to generate it yourself

            <li>
