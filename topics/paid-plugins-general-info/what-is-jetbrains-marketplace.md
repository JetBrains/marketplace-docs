[//]: # (title: What is JetBrains Marketplace?)

JetBrains Marketplace is an evolution of JetBrains plugins repository ([https://plugins.jetbrains.com](https://plugins.jetbrains.com)) which turns it into a marketplace for third-party plugin vendors (plugin developers) where they would be able to sell their plugins taking advantage of licensing and billing solution provided and maintained by JetBrains, in addition to currently available plugins repository for free plugins.

JetBrains is providing:

* Licensing solution by JetBrains, integrated with all JetBrains infrastructure (similar to how it works for JetBrains itself - generation of licenses, support for trial/evaluation licenses, licenses via [JetBrains Account](https://account.jetbrains.com) (JBA), license server, centralized licenses administration/management, licenses protection, special API in the product to check that user has a license, etc.)

* Billing / Sales infrastructure and distribution channel provided by JetBrains (payment processing, resellers network, sales support by JetBrains (end-user invoicing, refunds, etc.))

* Marketing and sales support (various activities to promote plugins via JetBrains or standalone channels.) 

There is a moderate commission for plugins sold via the Marketplace.
